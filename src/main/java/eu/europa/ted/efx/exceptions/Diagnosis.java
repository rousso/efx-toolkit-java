 * <p>Every type error starts with the same two sentences, whichever part of the translator finds
 * it: "Operator '==' cannot take 'text' and 'number'. Its right operand must be 'text'." Types are
 * named as a declaration writes them, with a star for a sequence, and a node is 'node'. Where the
 * mistake suggests what was meant, a sentence that says what to write instead follows them, such as
 * "To select by position, write [at n]."</p>
