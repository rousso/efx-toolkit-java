 * How EFX writes a function, a template or an operator: a function with the token before its

 * token beside its operands. A type error names what was written, and each of its arguments, by
 * its spelling.
 *
 * <p>A built-in is usually spelled by its own name, but a call may spell it otherwise:
 * {@code string} is a spelling of the function {@code text}, and {@code :preferredLanguage} spells
 * the function {@code preferred-language} as an operator after a field. A step that only a field
 * has, such as {@code :rawValue}, is spelled as an operator after the field. A function declared
 * in EFX is spelled with its prefix, as {@code ?greeting}.</p>
